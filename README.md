# SmartAssistant - Web Developer Interview Task

##Task 1 – the main task. HTML / CSS / JavaScript
Your main task is to create an one page html with “dynamic” content and neat CSS styling. The page should be created based on attached screenshots files (screenshot_page_1, screenshot_page_2) - the look should be similar. You should cut/extract all needed pictures from this files.

**Requirements:**

* solution should contains only one html file
* the question page 1 (screenshot_page_1) is a initial one (should be displayed at start)
* after clicking on the next button (WEITER) on the question page 1 a question page 2
(screenshot_page_2) should be displayed, previous button should be displayed and the next button
should disappear
* after clicking on the previous button (ZURUCK) on the question page 2, the next previous button should
be displayed and the next button should disappear
* add a button with special behaviour – after clicking on it the page appearance should change (for
example some elements change their colours), after clicking on it again previously applied changes
should be reverted
* you can add and use any JS library
